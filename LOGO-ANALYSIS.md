## WHAT I DID WRONG BEFORE

❌ Treated it as separate flat elements
❌ Didn't respect the circular/curved nature
❌ Wrong positioning of birds
❌ Didn't analyze the actual logo structure first

## WHAT NEEDS TO BE DONE

✅ Respect the circular composition
✅ Curved text positioning (arc layout)
✅ Proper bird placement with leaves
✅ Center-out animation flow
✅ Natural, organic motion (not mechanical)
